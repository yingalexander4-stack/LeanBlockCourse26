# Can you prove that a proof doesn't use a specific axiom?
{: .no_toc }

*March 9, 2026 · `P04.S04`*

---

In P04 we saw that `#print axioms` traces which axioms a theorem depends on. A natural follow-up question from the lecture: can we express *within the logic* that a proposition was proved without using a particular axiom (say, `Classical.choice`)? For example, could we write a type `ConstructivelyProvable P` that is inhabited exactly when `P` has a proof that avoids classical reasoning?

**The short answer is no.** Proof irrelevance makes this inexpressible as a `Prop` in Lean. But the question touches on deep issues in type theory, and the longer answer is worth exploring.

## Why proof irrelevance prevents this

Recall from P04 S02 that `Prop` is proof-irrelevant: any two proofs `h₁ h₂ : P` are definitionally equal. The kernel does not compare them — it only checks that *a* proof exists.

This means there is no predicate on proofs that could distinguish "proved constructively" from "proved classically." Both proofs inhabit the same type, and the type system considers them identical. You cannot pattern-match on a proof's internal structure, and you cannot ask which axioms were invoked during its construction.

As [*Theorem Proving in Lean 4*](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/axioms_and_computation.html) puts it:

> "The intention is that elements of a type `p : Prop` should play no role in computation, and so the particular construction of a term `prf : p` is 'irrelevant' in that sense."

The proof term is the only place where axiom dependencies live. Proof irrelevance erases exactly what you would need to track.

## `#print axioms` is meta-level

`#print axioms` and its metaprogramming counterpart `Lean.Environment.collectAxioms` work by inspecting the actual proof term in the environment *before* erasure. This is a **meta-level** operation — it examines the syntax tree of the proof, not its logical content. You could write a Lean 4 metaprogram or linter that checks whether `Classical.choice` appears in the transitive closure of a definition's dependencies, but this remains external to the logic.

```lean
-- This is a meta-level check, not a proposition:
#print axioms Nat.add_comm
-- [propext, Quot.sound]

-- There is no way to write:
-- theorem add_comm_is_constructive : AxiomFree Nat.add_comm := ...
-- because AxiomFree would need to inspect the proof term.
```

## What about partial workarounds?

Several mechanisms provide *related* guarantees without solving the full problem:

### `Decidable` (lives in `Type`, not `Prop`)

`Decidable P` carries computational content: it's either `isTrue (h : P)` or `isFalse (h : ¬P)`. Because it lives in `Type`, proof irrelevance doesn't apply — different `Decidable` instances are distinguishable. But `Decidable` characterizes *decidability*, not constructive provability. A proposition can be constructively provable without being decidable, and having a `Decidable` instance says nothing about whether the underlying proof of `P` used classical axioms.

### `noncomputable`

Lean requires definitions that use `Classical.choice` to produce data to be marked `noncomputable`. This is a partial signal — it tells you computational content was lost. But it only applies to definitions producing data in `Type`, not to proofs in `Prop`.

### Double negation translation

Glivenko's theorem (1929): a proposition `P` is provable in classical propositional logic if and only if `¬¬P` is provable in constructive propositional logic. The Gödel-Gentzen translation extends this to first-order logic. So `¬¬P` internally characterizes *classical provability*. But this is the wrong direction — it tells you what classical logic can prove, not whether a specific proof of `P` *avoided* classical logic. See the [nLab page on double negation translation](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+negation+translation) for details.

### Gödel encoding (in principle)

You could, in principle, encode "there exists a derivation of `P` in CIC without `Classical.choice`" as an arithmetic statement using Gödel numbering. This would be a proposition within the theory. But it would be a statement about *syntax* (the existence of a derivation), not *semantics* (the meaning of the proof), and would be enormously impractical.

## Lean's official stance

Leonardo de Moura stated on the [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Compartmentalization.20of.20axioms.20in.20Lean.204.html) that Lean does not attempt to compartmentalize axioms:

> "The bare-bones system can be used for constructive mathematics. That being said, a lot of the proof automation we are building is using axioms such as `propext`."

Core tactics like `simp` and `by_cases` rely on classical axioms, and de Moura recommended users who prioritize constructive mathematics consider Agda or Coq.

A [separate discussion](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/348111-std4/topic/How.20classical.20is.20std4.3F.html) revealed that even simple lemmas like `Nat.min_succ_succ` depend on `Classical.choice` because `split` invokes `Classical.em` rather than looking for `Decidable` instances. Mario Carneiro noted that Std4 "tries to avoid classical logic when it can be accomplished without significant difficulty," but fixing this requires changes to Lean's core.

## The trade-off

This limitation is not a bug in Lean's design — it is a *consequence* of a deliberate trade-off. Proof irrelevance buys you erasure (proofs cost nothing at runtime) and simplicity (you never need to worry about *which* proof you have). The price is that properties of proof terms — including axiom provenance — are invisible to the logic. The information exists (in the proof term), a meta-level tool can inspect it (`#print axioms`), but no proposition within the theory can express it.

Other systems make different trade-offs: **Agda** has no proof irrelevance by default, so its module system can structurally enforce axiom discipline (don't import LEM → nothing uses LEM). **Coq** has `Print Assumptions` (analogous to `#print axioms`) and faces the same fundamental limitation as Lean.

## Practical takeaway

In this course, we use classical logic freely — Mathlib does too. Use `#print axioms` when you're curious about a theorem's dependencies, but don't worry about avoiding axioms. The distinction matters for constructive mathematics and program extraction, not for the kind of formalization we're doing here.
