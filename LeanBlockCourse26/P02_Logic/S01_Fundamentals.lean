# Fundamentals of Lean Proofs
=====================

This module introduces the most basic building blocks for constructing proofs in Lean:
- Proving equalities with `rfl`
- Using hypotheses with `assumption`
- Precise matching with `exact`
- Basic implications (`→`) and the `intro` tactic
- Rewriting with `rw`

Note: Tactic usage counts in this course are approximate, measured against
Mathlib in February 2025.


## Proofs by reflexivity - the `rfl` tactic

The `rfl` tactic proves goals that are true by definition
and is (explicitly) used around 4000 times in mathlib and many
times more implicitly through `rw`, `exact`, `simp`, ...
-/

-- Simple equality: proves that 42 equals itself
theorem simple_int_eq : 42 = 42 := by
  rfl

#check simple_int_eq

theorem simple_int_eq' : (42 = 42 : Prop) := by
  rfl

-- Works with variables: proves that any proposition equals itself
example (P : Prop) : P = P := by
  rfl

-- also works in term mode
example (P : Prop) : P = P := rfl

-- Works with logical equivalence: proves that any proposition is equivalent to itself
example (P : Prop) : P ↔ P := by
  rfl

-- does *not* work in term mode!
-- example (P : Prop) : P ↔ P := rfl

-- Works with definitional equality: proves that 2 + 2 is 4 *by definition*
-- Why is this true? Because 4 = 0.succ.succ.succ.succ, 2 = 0.succ.succ
-- and a + b.succ = (a + b).succ, so unraveling everything, both sides reduce to
-- 0.succ.succ.succ.succ, which is four!
--
-- BUT: this only works because we are cleverly modelling Nat through DTT
-- as an inductive type, not explicitly through Peano axioms! -> P05
example : 2 + 2 = 4 := by
  rfl

-- Even works with type-level equality.
-- We will explore types in more detail later.
example (α : Type) : α = α := by
  rfl

-- Note that this does *not* work since ↔ only works
-- with Prop not arbitrary Type
-- example (α : Type) : α ↔ α := by
--   rfl

## Using hypotheses - the `assumption` tactic

The `assumption` tactic looks through the available hypotheses and tries to find one
that exactly matches the goal. This is useful when you already have exactly what you
need to prove in your context. This tactic is essentially unused in mathlib.
We will learn in a bit why.
-/

-- Given a natural number `n` where `10 > n` and `1 < n`, prove that `1 < n`
-- Note that the linter flags `h₁` as an unused assumption
example (n : ℕ) (h₁ : 10 > n) (h₂ : 1 < n) : 1 < n := by
  assumption

-- This also works because 1 < n is the same as n > 1 by reflexivity
example (n : ℕ) (h₁ : 10 > n) (h₂ : n > 1) : 1 < n := by
  assumption

example (n : ℕ) : (1 < n : Prop) = (n > 1 : Prop) := rfl

-- Given proposition `P` and its proof, prove `P`
--
-- `(P : Prop)` is just a proposition, it can be true, false, unprovable
-- a trivial lemma, a known theorem, an open conjecture, or complete garbage
-- 
-- `(p : P)` is an instanciation of `P` and therefore a proof to lean.
-- Notably we are not working with booleans or even ⊤ here!
example (P : Prop) (p : P) : P := by
  assumption

-- Given propositions `P` and `Q`, and proofs of both, prove `P`
-- `(P Q : Prop)` is just a short grouping of `(P : Prop) (Q : Prop)`
-- linting again complains about `(q : Q)` being unused, but 
-- `(Q : Prop)` is fine because `(q : Q)` uses it (until you remove it)
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P := by
  assumption

/-
## Precise matching - the `exact` tactic

The `exact` tactic allows us to provide a term that precisely matches the goal type.
Unlike assumption, which searches for matches, exact requires us to specify exactly
which term we want to use, but otherwise has the same effect. The `rfl` tactic in fact
was just syntax sugar for `exact rfl`. The tactic `exact?` looks for any term that can be
used to close the goal. This tactic is used over 40,000 times in mathlib.
-/

-- Given a natural number `n` where `10 > n` and `1 < n`, prove that `1 < n`
-- `_` makes the linter not complain, refers to intentionally unnamed variable
-- same as in many other languages. Note that `\N(at)` produces `ℕ`
example (n : ℕ) (_ : 10 > n) (h₂ : 1 < n) : 1 < n := by  
  exact h₂ -- `exact` is leans `return` (in tactic mode, in term mode its implicit)

-- Given proposition `P` and its proof, prove `P`
example (P : Prop) (p : P) : P := by
  exact p

-- Given propositions `P` and `Q`, and proofs of both, prove `P`
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (_ : Q) : P := by
  exact p

-- Exercise 1.1
-- State and prove that `3 + 2 = 5`

  rfl

-- Exercise 1.2
-- State and prove that given any arbitrary proposition `M`

example (M : Prop) (m : M) : M := by
  exact m

## Basic implications

An implication `P → Q` can be proved by assuming `P` and proving `Q`.
-/

-- `P → Q` means that `P` implies `Q`
-- `h : P → Q` means `h` is a proof of the proposition `P → Q`
-- the same way that `p : P` is a proof of the propositon `P`

-- Note that `\to` produces `→`
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P → Q) : P → Q := by
  assumption

example (P Q : Prop) (h : P → Q) : P → Q := by
  exact h

-- this is called term mode (more on this later)
-- but note that this is no different than in Python implementing
-- ```
-- def foo(n: int) -> int:
--    return n
-- ```
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P → Q) : P → Q := h

-- Given a function `h : P → Q` and a proof of `P`, we get a proof of `Q`
-- `h p` just "throws" the proof of `P` into `h`
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P → Q) (p : P) : Q := by
  exact h p

-- This in fact might be somewhat more intuitive in term mode
-- because it is similar to the following silly python code
--
-- ```
-- def foo(n: int) -> float:
--   return float(n)
--
-- def bar(x: float) -> str:
--   return str(x)
-- 
-- def foobar(n: int) -> str:
--   return bar(foo(n))
-- ```
-- 
-- Just note that function application in lean does not use brackets!
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P → Q) (p : P) : Q := h p

-- We can compose `P → Q` and `Q → R` to get from `P` to `R`
-- Note that `h\1` produces `h₁` and `h\2` produces `h₂`
example (P Q R : Prop) (p : P) (h₁ : P → Q) (h₂ : Q → R) : R := by
  exact h₂ (h₁ p) -- brackets are needed to group / bind correctly

-- Again works in term mode
example (P Q R : Prop) (p : P) (h₁ : P → Q) (h₂ : Q → R) : R := h₂ (h₁ p)

-- We can also *first* compose `h₁` and `h₂` and *then* throw in `p`
-- Note that `\circ` produces `∘`
example (P Q R : Prop) (p : P) (h₁ : P → Q) (h₂ : Q → R) : R := by
  exact (h₂ ∘ h₁) p

-- The `<|` operator is a function application operator that binds less tightly
-- than function application. It lets us avoid parentheses by applying functions
-- from right to left, so `h₂ <| h₁ p` is equivalent to `h₂ (h₁ p)`.
example (P Q R : Prop) (p : P) (h₁ : P → Q) (h₂ : Q → R) : R := by
  exact h₂ <| h₁ p

-- The dollar sign `$` used to be a synonym for this operator
-- but usage is now discouraged by the linter
example (P Q R : Prop) (p : P) (h₁ : P → Q) (h₂ : Q → R) : R := by
  exact h₂ $ h₁ p

## The `intro` tactic

The `intro` tactic is used to prove implications (`→`) by assuming the antecedent.
When proving `P → Q`, `intro p` creates a hypothesis `p : P` and changes the goal to `Q`.
It is used around 12,000 times in mathlib.

We already saw this for our proof that the composite of two continuous functions
is itself continuous. This is whatever implicitly happens in pen-and-paper proofs
when someone says "Let ... be ..." and it is clear that they are refering to
an assumption that they pulled from the proposition the want to show.
-/

-- The identity function: shows that any proposition implies itself
example (P : Prop) : P → P := by
  intro p
  exact p

-- Intro always applies when you have "LHS implies RHS"
-- and it instanciates the type LHS, so if LHS is a 
-- proposition, this means we assume a proof of LHS
example (P : Prop) : P → P := by
  intro p
  assumption

-- Note that `id` is one instantiation of P → P (regardless of the type of P)
example (P : Prop) : P → P := by
  exact id

-- Also works in term mode
example (P : Prop) : P → P := id

-- `id` itself is actually just lambda function type magic
example (P : Prop) : P → P := fun p => p

example : (fun (α : Type) => α) = id := rfl

## Exercise Block 2

-- Exercise 2.1
-- Show, in at least two different ways, that if

  sorry

-- Exercise 2.2
-- Show that if `P` implies `Q`, `Q` implies `R`, and

  sorry

-- Exercise 2.3
-- Show that if the proposition that `P` implies `Q`
-- implies the proposition `R` and if also `P` implies `Q`,

-- Exercise 2.3 (alt)
-- Show that if the proposition `P` implies the proposition that
